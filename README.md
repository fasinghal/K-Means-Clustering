# K-Means-Clustering
CS 6301 R for Data Scientists Lecture 4 -coursework - Unsupervised Learning - K Means Clustering

Datasets : Stoneflakes dataset (details : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/StoneFlakes)

The above work represents the class room projects/assignment for course CS 6301 R for Data Scientists. Aim of the project is to use K means clustering method for unsupervised learning and discovering groups/patterns in the dataset. The accuracy of the various methods of K Means Clustering is examined later by comparing the actual vs predicted classifications/clusters.

R Script for the project can be found in the .RHistory File.
